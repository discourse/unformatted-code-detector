I also just changed discobotâ€™s text a bit as an experiment on our site to see if a slightly different wording helps lower the volume.

It's still early for our relatively small site but this is looking promising.  In the month prior to changing this, 18 folks did that tutorial step and 4 flagged it wrong.  In the month+ since 17 have done that step and 0 got it wrong.  The new text adds a few more details about why you might flag a post but I'm guessing it's the very small change to the final sentence that's doing most of the work:

> We like our discussions friendly, and we need your help to [keep things civilized](%{guidelines_url}). If you see a problem, please flag to privately let the author, or [our helpful staff](%{about_url}), know about it.  There are many reasons you might want to flag a post ranging from an innocuous thread-splitting suggestion to a clear-cut standards violation.  If you select "something else," you'll start a private message discussion chain with the moderators in which you can ask further questions.
